Hi guys! My name is Ayushi and I’m a third year CS major in the College. This is my second semester TAing 2150. When I took this course I probably attended OH more than 100 times, so I’m excited to help you all the same way other TA’s helped me! When I’m not in office hours, I’m either participating in WiCS & GWC here on grounds or reading conspiracy theories and visiting new coffee shops. Really looking forward to meeting you guys this semester :)

Hi everyone! My name is AJ Cuddeback, I use they/them pronouns, and I'm from Medford, Massachusetts. I'm currently a 4th year studying Electrical and Computer Engineering and I've been TAing 2150 since Fall 2019.

I'm passionate about memes (I did a TedxUVA talk on them my second year), Dunkin' iced coffee, and my bike, Phoebe. A fun (sad?) fact about me is that I've had more concussions than UVA has had presidents.

And never hesitate to ask for help - I know I used office hours a lot when I was taking 2150!

When I'm not TAing I work in a physics lab, play video games, and exercise. I love being a TA for 2150 because I think it is one of the most fundamental CS courses that teaches a lot of very useful skills that will be needed later on in school and in your career. I also know it is very challenging and I want to help students get as much out of this course as possible. I also enjoy talking about any other CS topics as well so feel free to ask me anything!

I love cafes/bakeries and I would (ideally) like to open my own bakery one day!

Hey everyone, welcome to CS2150! I'm a 4th year CS and Econ major who's really excited to finally TA for this course - it is the one I learned the most in and will also truly prepare all of you for just about every CS course afterwards. While I don't have many extracurriculars outside of class, I'm pretty involved with different jobs across grounds. This class may seem/feel/be a bit overwhelming at times, but at the end you will realize it was all necessary. And some of you will truly appreciate C++ over other languages after this :) I look forward to helping you all this semester!

Hi everyone! I'm a third-year CS/CpE double major. I knew I wanted to TA CS 2150 the moment I was inspired by Binky's Pointer Fun, and I guess I really like helping people too.<p>I play club water polo here for fun, so if you're ever looking for a new activity to try let me know! My favorite movie is Inception, and my favorite jelly bean flavor is anything but buttered popcorn. I'm excited to work with you all and hope you have a great semester!
