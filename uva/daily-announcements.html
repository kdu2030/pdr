## Lecture 17: Fri, Oct 1st
- [Lab 5](../labs/lab05/index.html) (and the tutorial) is all ready
  - The week after next is UVA's fall break, so no lab then
- We'll go over the [first midterm](../exams/exam1-f21.pdf) today
  - And talk about regrades (next slide)
  - The exam will receive a 15 *percentage* point curve -- we'll talk about how that will be applied
- Office hours are in full swing
    - TA office hours are 5pm - 11pm on Sunday, Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday
    - Faculty office hours are M/F 9:30 am - 11:00 am (Bloomfield in Rice 402) and Wed noon - 1:30 pm (Floryan in Rice 203)
    - Online office hours are ONLY for those with COVID-19 or quarantining due to a potential exposure; if this applies to you, fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/7MaZkZ3mtY8dtrpE6)
    - We are going to strictly limit the TAs to 5 minutes per student for in-person office hours
- Course links are on the Collab landing page
- [Anonymous feedback](https://collab.its.virginia.edu/x/JunIx3)!  It's through Collab
- [Readings](../docs/readings.html) are optional, and are posted in the git repo
- Today we will continue with [Trees](../slides/05-trees.html#/), which will take us into next week

## Regrades
- You can submit a regrade request if we mis-graded your exam
  - Submission is through Gradescope
- You need to expalin clearly (and BRIEFLY) why your answer should get more credit
- Did you lose points because your exam was hard to read?
    - The scanner had some issues with exam writing that wasn't dark enough
    - Please type up what you wrote in the exam regrade, and we'll regrade it without penalty
	- If you can't read it either, we'll look up the paper exam
- If you submit regrades that do not get points back, we reserve the right to LOWER your overall exam grade
    - We are trying to prevent frivolous regrades, and to prevent everybody from having us regrade their entire exam when it was graded properly the first time
- Regrades open today (Frdiay, 10/1) at 3pm, and close about 10 days later (Monday, 10/11) at the end of the day
    - Regrades will not be accepted outside that time window
