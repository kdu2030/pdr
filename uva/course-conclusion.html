## Course Objectives

<div style="font-size:67%">
<ul>
<li>Understand program representation from the high-level programming language perspective down to the underlying machine level representation, including: number representation, operations, conditionals, and control structures</li>
<li>Be able to implement basic and advanced abstract data types in C++ including: linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, trees, and graphs</li>
<li>Be able to evaluate asymptotic time and space complexity analysis of programs and data structure implementations using Big-O, Big-Omega, and Big-Theta notation and assess the suitability of a data structure for a particular problem</li>
<li>Understand the basic program execution model and the underlying computer hardware and software (fetch-execute cycle, memory hierarchy, operating system, compiler)</li>
<li>Be able to implement basic program control and data structures in an assembly language (loops, conditionals, subroutines and parameter passing modes, arrays)</li>

## What was new this semester
- Face-to-face for the first time in over a year
- Almost all the TAs had to be trained to handle in-person office hours
- A LOT more "special cases" than we typically handle
- A lower level of preparation from CS 2110 than when it was in person
- Many tweaks and updates to the [github repo](https://github.com/uva-cs/pdr)
- A somewhat reasonable amount of TA resources
- One of the largest enrollments ever (472 students)

## What didn't work well
- More individual student issues (illness, mental health) than is typical, which was a challenge for us to handle in a timely manner
- A lower level of prepration from CS 2110 because it was online
- Not enough TA office hours
- M1 Macs not being able to run x86 assembly

## CS 2150 Enrollment Graph
![enrollment graph](enrollment.svg)
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## What did work well
- Gradescope as the submission system (even if there were tweaks to be made)
  - Especially the support ticket system, even if we were occassionally slow to respond
- The office hours queue system
- An excellent group of undergraduate TAs and an amazing graduate TA
- None of the labs had any major issues!  W00t!
  - (labs 6 & 10 do not count as "major issues")
- Use of the [github repo](https://github.com/uva-cs/pdr), and almost no use of Collab
- Behind-the-scenes stuff: TA management, organization, etc.
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Did we push too hard?
- We got as many "things are going great" comments as "things are going terrible"
- Part of the issues were the hard labs
- This course is meant to be a lot of work: a gateway into the CS electives
- The goal is to make you work efficiently, not necessarily more
- In hindsight, considering how much you accomplished this semester, was it still too much work?
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Changes for next semester
- The last full semester of CS 2150
  - The course content is being split into multiple courses in the new curriculum
- Updates to the content in the [github repo](https://github.com/uva-cs/pdr) (some of which is listed in the [github repo issues](https://github.com/uva-cs/pdr/issues))
- With the office hour queue data, we can better target where to staff extra TAs for the busiest office hours
- A higher TA-to-student ratio
- Course content changes (next slide)
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## CS 2150 moving forward
- This course is going to be replaced in a big curriculum change
  - The content will move into DSA2 and COA1
  - That is likely to happen in the fall of 2022
- Spring 2021 changes
  - Not much, really...
